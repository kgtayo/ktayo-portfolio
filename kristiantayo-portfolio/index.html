    <h2>Welcome to Kristian's World</h2>
    
    <em>Design and illustration with hustle and heart</em>
    
    <p>In the world of Kristian Tayo, everyone has an equal opportunity to compete while staying authentic to the very core of who they are. Kristian's best works shine brightly because he aims to best represent small-to-medium enterprises, brands, ideas, products, and advocacies and help them reach bigger audiences through well-founded research and thought processes, transparent and efficient collaboration, and unique executions. At the center of his works will always be a balance of hustling to achieve the best and beyond; and, using visual communication to touch audiences' hearts.</p>
